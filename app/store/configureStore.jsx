 * @description This file is meant to configure our Redux store.

 * @description We'll configure the Redux store.

 * @description We use applyMiddleware, compose, and createStore methods exported from 'redux'.
 *
 * @description We'll configure the store with middleware:
 *      routerMiddleware from 'react-router-redux'
 *      thunkMiddleware from 'redux-thunk'
 *
 * @description We'll also be using the Redux devToolsExtension.
 *
 * Make sure to install the extension from:
